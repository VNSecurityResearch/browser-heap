1. Page heap is Window build-in support for heap verification. There are two modes:

- FULL page-heap places a non-accessible page at the end of the allocation. Full-page heap has high memory requirements. Its advantage is that a process will access violate (AV) exactly at the point of illegal memory operation.

- NORMAL page-heap checks fill patterns when the block gets freed. Normal page heap can be used for testing large-scale process without the high memory consumption overhead of full-page heap. 
However, normal page heap delays detection until the blocks are freed - thus failures are more difficult to debug.

When an application foo.exe is launched, Windows looks up in "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\foo.exe" for page heap and other settings of the executable and acts accordingly.

2. To turn on page heap for an executable, one just needs to modify the settings in registry. Gflags is a utility downloadable from Microsoft to edit settings under "Image File Execution Options".
